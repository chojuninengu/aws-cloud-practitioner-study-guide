## üíª HANDS-ON EXERCISES

### Exercise 1: Region and AZ Exploration (10 minutes)
1. Log into AWS Educate console
2. **Region Switching Exercise**:
   - Start in US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1
   - Switch to Europe (Ireland) - eu-west-1
   - Switch to Asia Pacific (Tokyo) - ap-northeast-1
   - Switch to South America (S√£o Paulo) - sa-east-1
3. **Document**: Note the services available in each region
4. **Observe**: How the console URL changes with regions

### Exercise 2: EC2 Multi-AZ Deployment (15 minutes)
1. **Launch EC2 instances in different AZs**:
   - Instance 1: us-east-1a (t2.micro)
   - Instance 2: us-east-1b (t2.micro)
   - Instance 3: us-east-1c (t2.micro)
2. **Compare**:
   - Instance IDs
   - Private IP addresses
   - Subnet assignments
3. **Terminate all instances** (avoid charges)

### Exercise 3: Global Latency Test (5 minutes)
1. Use [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
2. **Identify**: Which services are global vs regional
3. **Plan**: If serving users in Japan, Europe, and USA - which regions would you choose?

## ‚ùì MASTERY QUIZ - Answer ALL Before Proceeding to Day 3

### Section A: Infrastructure Fundamentals (Must get 4/5 correct)

1. **What's the minimum number of Availability Zones in an AWS Region?** Explain why this number matters for high availability.

2. **Difference between Region, AZ, and Edge Location**: Define each and give an example of when you'd use the concept in architecture decisions.

3. **Data Sovereignty**: A European company must keep customer data in Europe. How does AWS global infrastructure support this requirement?

4. **Latency vs Availability**: You can choose between a single region with 3 AZs or 2 regions with 2 AZs each. For a real-time trading application, which would you choose and why?

5. **Edge Locations**: How do CloudFront edge locations improve performance? Give a specific example with a global e-commerce site.

### Section B: Architectural Thinking (Must get 3/4 correct)

6. **Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region**: When would you use each strategy? Give specific use cases for both.

7. **Disaster Recovery**: Explain the difference between backup/restore, pilot light, warm standby, and multi-site DR strategies.

8. **Global Load Balancing**: How would you route traffic for users in Tokyo, London, and New York to provide the best experience?

9. **Compliance and Regions**: A healthcare company needs HIPAA compliance. How does region selection impact their compliance strategy?

### Section C: Practical Application (Must get 2/2 correct)

10. **Cost vs Performance**: Deploying in multiple regions increases costs but improves performance. How would you make this trade-off decision?

11. **Service Availability**: Not all AWS services are available in all regions. How would this impact your architecture decisions for a global application?
